<div class="h1">Collaborative Learning and Challenges in Unity Game Development: Reflections on Sprint 1</div>
<div class="t1">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sprint 1, our team members experienced working on a Unity project in a collaborative
    environment for the first time in their lives. <br />
    Throughout this process, our team members contributed numerous excellent ideas and suggestions, which were crucial
    to our group's success. <br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary focus of our learning in this project revolved around the C# programming
    language, along with the
    essential aspects of communicating and coordinating with each other to keep track of everyone's progress.<br />
    Due to the varying pace of each individual and the inherent difficulties of game development, we encountered
    multiple challenges, such as numerous code conflicts during content allocation and the difficulty of reducing code
    coupling, which necessitated further optimization in modularization.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next sprint, we will consider revising our workload distribution methods. In the
    original allocation
    approach, we did not account for the high coupling, which led to many issues during distribution, such as code
    placement, implementation dependencies, and conflicts.<br />
    <br />
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, since our team members are all proactive, we have experienced conflicting
    ideas. Resolving these
    conflicts will be one of the main areas we will focus on moving forward as a team.

    What we've done:
    <div class="t1">
        We learned how to use Unity to create games. As we were all new to Unity, each of us learned a lot and deepened
        our understanding while working together.

    <div class="t1">
        We learned how to use Visual Studio to write C# code.
    </div>
    <div class="t1">
        We learned how to use GitHub to collaborate on code through different branches.
    </div>
    <div class="t1">
        We added new user stories because we believed that certain features were necessary, such as functionalities or
        characteristics upon which other features depended.
