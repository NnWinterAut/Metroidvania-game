            Independent: Yes, because an Easter Egg is typically an optional hidden feature that is not required for the main gameplay experience.

            Negotiable: Yes, because the specific Easter Egg(s) implemented in the game can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities.

            Valuable: Yes, because Easter Eggs can add an extra layer of fun and surprise to the game, increasing player engagement and potentially generating positive word-of-mouth.

            Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement the Easter Egg(s) can be estimated based on their complexity and the resources available to the team.

            Small: Yes, because the Easter Egg(s) can be implemented as a relatively isolated and straightforward feature that does not have a significant impact on the rest of the game.

            Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the Easter Egg(s) can be triggered correctly and do not interfere with the main gameplay experience.
