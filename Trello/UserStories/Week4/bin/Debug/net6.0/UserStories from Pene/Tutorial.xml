        Independent: No, because the "Tutorial" feature often depends on other features or systems in the game to teach the player how to play. For example, a tutorial on how to use weapons would rely on the existence of weapons in the game.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of how the tutorial is implemented can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities, such as the amount of content, the pacing, and the format.
        
        Valuable: Yes, because a tutorial can greatly enhance the player's experience by helping them learn the mechanics of the game, understand the story or lore, and prevent frustration from confusion or lack of guidance.
        
        Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to create a tutorial can be estimated based on the scope and complexity of the game mechanics, the amount of content needed to cover, and the resources available.
        
        Small: No, because creating a comprehensive and effective tutorial can be a significant effort and may require a dedicated team or resources.
        
        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the tutorial is effective in teaching the player the game mechanics and providing them with the necessary guidance.
