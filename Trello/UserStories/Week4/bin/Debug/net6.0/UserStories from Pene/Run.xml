        Independent: No, because the "Run" feature likely relies on other game mechanics and systems, such as character movement and animation.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of how the "Run" feature is implemented can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities.

        Valuable: Yes, because the "Run" feature can provide players with a faster way to traverse the game world, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

        Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement the "Run" feature can be estimated based on factors such as the desired speed and animation, as well as the resources available to the team.

        Small: Yes, because the "Run" feature can be a relatively isolated and self-contained feature within the game, especially if the team reuses existing assets and mechanics.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the "Run" feature works correctly, does not result in unintended consequences, and enhances the overall gameplay experience.
