        Independent: Yes, because one-way platforms can typically be implemented as a self-contained feature that does not rely on other game systems or mechanics.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of the one-way platform mechanic can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement one-way platforms with different materials, shapes, or behaviors.

        Valuable: Yes, because one-way platforms can add depth and challenge to the game, providing players with new obstacles to overcome and increasing the variety of platforming mechanics.

        Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement one-way platforms can be estimated based on the desired number and complexity of the platforms, as well as the resources available to the team.

        Small: Yes, because implementing one-way platforms can be relatively straightforward and isolated, especially if the team chooses to reuse existing assets and mechanics.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the one-way platform mechanic works correctly, is reliable, and does not result in unintended consequences such as collision issues or broken gameplay.
