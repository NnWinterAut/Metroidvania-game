        Independent: Yes, because the ability to jump is typically a self-contained feature that does not rely on other game systems or mechanics.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of the jump mechanic can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement a double jump or a variable height jump.

        Valuable: Yes, because the ability to jump is a fundamental mechanic that allows players to navigate the game world, reach new areas, and avoid obstacles.

        Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement the jump mechanic can be estimated based on its complexity and the resources available to the team.

        Small: Yes, because implementing the jump mechanic can be relatively straightforward and isolated, especially if the team chooses to implement a basic jump without additional features.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the jump mechanic works correctly, is responsive and accurate, and does not result in unintended consequences such as getting stuck or falling through the game world.
