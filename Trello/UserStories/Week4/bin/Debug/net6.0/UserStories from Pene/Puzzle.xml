        Independent: No, because puzzles usually rely on other game mechanics and systems to function properly. For example, a puzzle that involves moving blocks requires the game to have a block movement mechanic.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specific type and difficulty of puzzles can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities.

        Valuable: Yes, because puzzles can provide players with challenges and obstacles to overcome, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

        Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement puzzles can be estimated based on the desired number and complexity of the puzzles, as well as the resources available to the team.

        Small: Yes, because puzzles can be relatively isolated and self-contained features within the game, especially if the team reuses existing assets and mechanics.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the puzzles work correctly, are solvable, and do not result in unintended consequences such as blocking player progress or breaking the game.
