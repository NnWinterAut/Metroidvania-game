        Independent: No, because the implementation of different difficulty levels may rely on other systems or features in the game, such as enemy AI or level design.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the exact number and names of the difficulty levels can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities.

        Valuable: Yes, because offering multiple difficulty levels can increase player engagement and satisfaction by allowing players to tailor the game experience to their own skill level.

        Estimable: No, because the level of effort required to implement multiple difficulty levels depends on the complexity of the game systems and may require significant development time.

        Small: No, because implementing multiple difficulty levels is a significant feature that may require a dedicated team effort.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that each difficulty level offers a unique and appropriate level of challenge for players.
