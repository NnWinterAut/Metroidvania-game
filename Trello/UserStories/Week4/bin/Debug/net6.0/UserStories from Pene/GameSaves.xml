        Independent: No, because the implementation of game saves requires integration with other game systems such as save/load functionality, storage management, and potentially network connectivity.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specific save/load functionality can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement manual save points or an automatic checkpoint system.

        Valuable: Yes, because the ability to save and continue the game progress later is essential for many players, especially those who cannot complete the game in one session.

        Estimable: No, because the level of effort required to implement game saves depends on the complexity of the game and the desired save/load functionality. It can be difficult to estimate without detailed planning and design.

        Small: No, because implementing game saves can require a significant effort in terms of planning, design, and development, especially for larger games.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the save/load functionality works correctly and does not result in any data loss or corruption.
