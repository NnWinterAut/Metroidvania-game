        Independent: No, because the "SFX" feature is likely to depend on other features in the game, such as animations or events, to trigger the appropriate sound effects.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of which sound effects to include and how they are implemented can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities.

        Valuable: Yes, because sound effects can enhance the player's experience by providing feedback on actions or events, adding immersion to the game world, and creating a more polished game overall.

        Estimable: No, because the level of effort required to implement the "SFX" feature is difficult to estimate without knowing the specific sounds required and how they are implemented.

        Small: Yes, because the "SFX" feature can be a relatively isolated and self-contained feature within the game, especially if the team reuses existing sound assets and mechanics.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the sound effects are playing as intended and enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
