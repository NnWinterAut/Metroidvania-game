        Independent: No, because hints typically rely on other features or systems in the game to provide guidance to the player. For example, a hint about how to defeat a boss may depend on the boss mechanics and the available weapons or items.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specific hints provided in the game can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to provide hints that are more or less explicit.

        Valuable: Yes, because hints can help players who may be struggling with certain aspects of the game, improving their experience and increasing engagement.

        Estimable: No, because the level of effort required to implement hints depends on the complexity of the game and the desired hint mechanics. It can be difficult to estimate without detailed planning and design.

        Small: Yes, because implementing hints can be relatively straightforward and isolated, especially if the team chooses to provide hints in a text-based format.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the hints are displayed correctly and that they provide helpful guidance to the player without giving away too much information.
