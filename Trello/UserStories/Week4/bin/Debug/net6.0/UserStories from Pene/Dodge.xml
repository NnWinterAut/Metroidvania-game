        Independent: Yes, because the "Dodge" feature can be implemented as a standalone system that is not dependent on other game features or systems.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of how the "Dodge" feature works (e.g. how fast the player moves, how many times they can dodge in a row, etc.) can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities.

        Valuable: Yes, because the "Dodge" feature can enhance the player's ability to avoid obstacles or enemy attacks, making the game more engaging and rewarding.

        Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement the "Dodge" feature can be estimated based on the complexity of the desired mechanics and the resources available to the team.

        Small: Yes, because the "Dodge" feature can be implemented as a relatively isolated and straightforward system that is not overly complex.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the "Dodge" feature functions correctly and is balanced with the rest of the game mechanics.
