        Independent: Yes, because portals can typically be implemented as a self-contained feature that does not rely on other game systems or mechanics.

        Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of the portal mechanic can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement different types of portals that transport players to different locations or time periods.

        Valuable: Yes, because portals can add depth and complexity to the game, providing players with new ways to navigate the game world and solve puzzles.

        Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement portals can be estimated based on the desired number and complexity of the portals, as well as the resources available to the team.

        Small: Yes, because implementing portals can be relatively straightforward and isolated, especially if the team chooses to reuse existing assets and mechanics.

        Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the portal mechanic works correctly, is reliable, and does not result in unintended consequences such as getting stuck or breaking the game.
