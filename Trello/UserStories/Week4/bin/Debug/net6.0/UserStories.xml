        <DescriptionZH>单向可跳跃平台，可以从下方穿过该平台以便快速到达上方</DescriptionZH>
        <INVEST>
            Independent: Yes, because one-way platforms can typically be implemented as a self-contained feature that does not rely on other game systems or mechanics.
    
            Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of the one-way platform mechanic can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement one-way platforms with different materials, shapes, or behaviors.
    
            Valuable: Yes, because one-way platforms can add depth and challenge to the game, providing players with new obstacles to overcome and increasing the variety of platforming mechanics.
    
            Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement one-way platforms can be estimated based on the desired number and complexity of the platforms, as well as the resources available to the team.
    
            Small: Yes, because implementing one-way platforms can be relatively straightforward and isolated, especially if the team chooses to reuse existing assets and mechanics.
    
            Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the one-way platform mechanic works correctly, is reliable, and does not result in unintended consequences such as collision issues or broken gameplay.

        <INVEST>
            Independent: No, because the "Run" feature likely relies on other game mechanics and systems, such as character movement and animation.
    
            Negotiable: Yes, because the specifics of how the "Run" feature is implemented can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities.
    
            Valuable: Yes, because the "Run" feature can provide players with a faster way to traverse the game world, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.
    
            Estimable: Yes, because the level of effort required to implement the "Run" feature can be estimated based on factors such as the desired speed and animation, as well as the resources available to the team.
    
            Small: Yes, because the "Run" feature can be a relatively isolated and self-contained feature within the game, especially if the team reuses existing assets and mechanics.

        <DescriptionZH>游戏可以进行存档，在重新进入游戏时不会丢失进度</DescriptionZH>
        <INVEST>
            Independent: No, because the implementation of game saves requires integration with other game systems such as save/load functionality, storage management, and potentially network connectivity.
    
            Negotiable: Yes, because the specific save/load functionality can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement manual save points or an automatic checkpoint system.
    
            Valuable: Yes, because the ability to save and continue the game progress later is essential for many players, especially those who cannot complete the game in one session.
    
            Estimable: No, because the level of effort required to implement game saves depends on the complexity of the game and the desired save/load functionality. It can be difficult to estimate without detailed planning and design.
    
            Small: No, because implementing game saves can require a significant effort in terms of planning, design, and development, especially for larger games.
    
            Testable: Yes, because the team can create test cases to ensure that the save/load functionality works correctly and does not result in any data loss or corruption.
