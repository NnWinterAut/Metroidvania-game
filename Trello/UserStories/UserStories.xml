            Independent - No, because stages (game levels) are often dependent on other aspects of the game, such as character progression, game mechanics, and level design. They cannot be developed or implemented in isolation from the rest of the game.
    
            Negotiable - Yes, because stages can be modified, re-ordered, or redesigned based on the needs of the game, the feedback from playtesters, or to accommodate changes in other parts of the game. The specifics of each stage can be discussed and adjusted as needed.
    
            Valuable - Yes, because stages are a core component of most games, providing variety, challenge, and a sense of progression to players. Well-designed stages can greatly enhance the overall gameplay experience and keep players engaged.
    
            Estimable - No, because accurately estimating the time and effort required to develop a stage can be difficult due to the complex interdependencies between stages and other game elements. Unexpected issues or changes in design may arise during development, affecting the initial estimates.
    
            Small - No, because creating a stage usually involves multiple elements, including level design, art, sound, programming, and testing. Depending on the complexity of the game, developing a stage can be a significant undertaking and may not fit the criteria for a small user story.
    
            Testable - Yes, because stages can be tested for functionality, difficulty, balance, and overall enjoyment. Testing can be done through internal testing teams or by gathering feedback from players during playtesting sessions. This helps identify issues or areas for improvement before the final release of the game.

            Negotiable - Yes, because the specifics of the one-way platform mechanic can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement one-way platforms with different materials, shapes, or behaviors.
    
            Valuable - Yes, because one-way platforms can add depth and challenge to the game, providing players with new obstacles to overcome and increasing the variety of platforming mechanics.
    
            Estimable - Yes, because the level of effort required to implement one-way platforms can be estimated based on the desired number and complexity of the platforms, as well as the resources available to the team.
    
            Small - Yes, because implementing one-way platforms can be relatively straightforward and isolated, especially if the team chooses to reuse existing assets and mechanics.
    
            Testable - Yes, because the team can create tests to ensure that the one-way platform mechanic works correctly, is reliable, and does not result in unintended consequences such as collision issues or broken gameplay.

        <DescriptionZH>游戏可以进行存档，在重新进入游戏时不会丢失进度</DescriptionZH>
        <INVEST>
            Independent - No, because the implementation of game saves requires integration with other game systems such as save/load functionality, storage management, and potentially network connectivity.
    
            Negotiable - Yes, because the specific save/load functionality can be adjusted based on the team's resources and priorities. For example, the team can choose to implement manual save points or an automatic checkpoint system.
    
            Valuable - Yes, because the ability to save and continue the game progress later is essential for many players, especially those who cannot complete the game in one session.
    
            Estimable - No, because the level of effort required to implement game saves depends on the complexity of the game and the desired save/load functionality. It can be difficult to estimate without detailed planning and design.
    
            Small - No, because implementing game saves can require a significant effort in terms of planning, design, and development, especially for larger games.
    
            Testable - Yes, because the team can create tests to ensure that the save/load functionality works correctly and does not result in any data loss or corruption.
